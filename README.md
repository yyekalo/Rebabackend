Rebu is helping app for ride sharing driver. It pridicts high demand area by searching events in different website (such as eventbrite) and rendering the demand as heat map. This app helps riders predict more profitable area and time. 

The following code is the back end which run on a rasbery pi server. 

I will creat another repository for the front end of the ios app in the near future.
